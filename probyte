<p style="text-align: justify;">Linux Commands are reserved words the operating system uses to perform specific actions using a terminal or command line. A Linux terminal is an interface or program with which commands can be executed. The first step is to locate the program in the terminal. This tutorial is based on the Ubuntu 16.04 distribution.&nbsp;Linux zip&nbsp;is written in this program or terminal.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>What is a Linux command?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A command is an instruction that tells the operating system a task to perform. Sometimes there are basic commands that allow you to create, modify or move files and folders. On other occasions, the&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://www.probyte.org/linux-commands/" rel="nofollow">linux commands</a></strong>&nbsp;allow running or executing a program or process in the OS. A terminal or a program is required to execute commands through, for example, the system library for computer programs from c++.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>What is a terminal?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A terminal is a program that can execute commands. Before graphic elements such as buttons or graphical text input elements, the terminal was the only option to interact with the OS.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>What is the Linux Ubuntu operating system?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you ask anyone who has used Linux on their computer for a long time, they will no doubt tell you that Ubuntu is one of the best Linux-based distributions. As for Ubuntu itself, it is a Linux distribution developed based on the well-known Debian distribution and is sponsored by Canonical Ltd.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Note that since&nbsp;ubuntu&nbsp;is an open-source operating system, you can edit the code to your liking. You can also install all the copies you want and even distribute Ubuntu modified by you. This is because Ubuntu has no license fees, making it a free operating system and fully modifiable.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Inside, Ubuntu contains the Linux kernel, to which the necessary software has been added to be a truly functional operating system that can be used on all types of devices. If you wonder what the Linux kernel is, the first thing you should know is that the kernel is not an operating system. It is a set of computer instructions that allow communication between software applications and data processing at the hardware level.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://www.probyte.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/download-3-300x150.webp" alt="" width="400" height="400" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Hence, the Linux kernel is used by various operating systems, such as the popular Android that comes in mobile phones and tablets. This is possible since the Linux kernel is available under the General Public License. The same happens with&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://www.probyte.org/" rel="nofollow">ubuntu focal</a></strong>. Hence it is free.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you have to differentiate Ubuntu from Linux, you must say that Linux is a kernel on which Ubuntu is based, which is an operating system. For Ubuntu to be an operating system, it includes not only the Linux kernel but also a set of software, among which are, for example, a desktop environment, a display server, and a sound server, among many other components.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But this is optional to know if you are a common user and are not thinking of developing a Linux distribution. In that case,&nbsp;nginx proxy&nbsp;is only required so that you know that with Ubuntu installed on your computer. You will have all the tools necessary to carry out your tasks comfortably.&nbsp;</p>
